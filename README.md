##  The Spark
*Shades of love* rooted in our minds when we came to know about the crisis the LGBTQ community passes through after coming out as their original identity. We conducted a survey to learn more about their lives and were determined to work for this cause. While many privileged ones in the community could afford their expenses, the ordinary people turns to be financially unstable and isolated. Our initiative is to provide them a safe space where they can promote and trade their small scale businesses and also a home to open up their worries.

## How it works
Bringing together the community under this shade so as to promote their small scale businesses by which they attain financial stability. The people in there can also get access to mental health professionals as from the survey conducted we came to know that most of the people in this community undergoes depression. We provide it with discussion forums so that people can be invited and also conduct talks.

## Hurdles in our way
-	Lack of initial capital
-	Less attention from the society

## The feathers in our hat
-	Able to provide loans
-	Availability of mental health professionals for members in need

## Our great lessons
The lessons in the path were hard. From our survey we learnt about the mental health issues faced by the LGBTQ community. Their small scale business gets less attention from the mainstream. The rainbow capitalism which emerges in the pride month makes the queer owned businesses much worse. So we needed best presentation to make our initiative a success and to seek attention among the crowd.

## Our future in *Shades of love*
We are planning to expand our project to much more audience by organising giveaways. The resources tab with more features where the members can seek financial advices and also legal help for their small businesses
